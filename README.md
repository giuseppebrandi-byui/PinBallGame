# Overview

To further develop my skills as a software developer it is worth dedicating some time to the field of game development. This is bacause we want to be able to learn other technologies as soon as possible and adapt to a changing market.

The user has the option to use the arrows or WSAD keys to control the plane and consequently make the sphere roll towards the targets. Every time the user hits a target he/she scores one point. When the 7 points threshold is achieved the level number encreases. If the ball falls under the plane the game ends and a message is displayed.

The purpose for writing this software is to become more familiar with the game development industry and overcome challenges while completing the various tasks.
