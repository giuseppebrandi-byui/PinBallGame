# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->
To further develop my skills as a software developer it is worth dedicating some time to the field of game development. This is bacause we want to be able to learn other technologies as soon as possible and adapt to a changing market.

<!-- {Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.} -->
The user has the option to use the arrows or WSAD keys to control the plane and consequently make the sphere roll towards the targets. Every time the user hits a target he/she scores one point. When the 12 points threshold is achieved the level of difficulty encreases. 

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
The purpose for writing this software is to become more familiar with the game development industry and overcome challenges while completing the various tasks.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
